## Current State of the Project

As the app stands, users can post to a wall, refresh the feed with a swipe refresh, look at local ski resorts and the respective weather, open the message screen, and view their basic user profile.

### Known Deficiencies & Unimplemented Elements: 

  * Uploading a picture through the android device to the wall or profile.
  
  * Sending and receiving messages to users in the app.
  
  * Adding friends in the app and displaying them in a friend's list.
  
  * Choosing ski resorts as a favorite ski resort to display as a list in the profile.
  
  * Displaying aspects of a trip to the user profile or leaderboard such as distance traveled or total days ridden for a given season.
  
### Cosmetic & Aesthetic Improvements:

  * UI design for the list of messages and messages within a conversation.
  
  * Uploading multiple images to the User profile
  
  * Scrolling in the user profile section with the recycler view
  
### Stretch Goals

  * Adding friends and having a friend's list to load other users profiles.
  
  * Messaging other users through the application

  * Having a section in the app to display information in regard to their distance traveled and days logged to an international leaderboard to compare with other users.
  
  * A local feed based on GPS vs a national feed that all users of the app can see.
